\abstract{This article presents the implementation of support for the
WAVE audio format in the Weaver Game Engine. In accordance with the
engine's modular design, proper support for the WAVE format requires
the definition of an extraction function that reads the audio file,
obtains auxiliary functions for memory allocation and deallocation,
and populates a sound structure with an OpenAL audio buffer.}

\secao{1. Introduction}

The WAVE format is one of the many types of the so-called RIFF
format. Every RIFF file represents a generic packed data sequence. The
WAVE format, specifically, is designed to encapsulate audio data.

Our goal in this article is to define a loading function with the
following signature:

@<Function Declaration (wave.h)@>=
void _extract_wave(void *(*permanent_alloc)(size_t),
                   void (*permanent_free)(void *),
                   void *(*temporary_alloc)(size_t),
                   void (*temporary_free)(void *),
                   void (*before_loading_interface)(void),
                   void (*after_loading_interface)(void),
                   char *source_filename, void *interface);
@

A function with this signature is used in the Weaver Game Engine to
interpret audio files. Its purpose is to populate the structure
pointed to by the last parameter. The definition of this structure can
be accessed by including the appropriate header from the Weaver Game
Engine:

@<Local Headers (wave.c)@>=
#include "interface.h"
@

Specifically, the structure is defined as follows:

\alinhaverbatim
struct sound {
  (...)
  bool _loaded_sound; // Has the sound been loaded?
  ALuint buffer;      // References buffer containing audio data
};
\alinhanormal

Our task is to fill the OpenAL buffer field within this
structure. Once we are done, we must set the boolean variable above to
true. This informs the game engine that the sound is ready for use.

The buffer is populated by the loading function when it reads the
\monoespaco{source\_filename} file, which must be in the WAVE format.

The loading function is also responsible for calling the
\monoespaco{before\_loading\_interface} function before performing any
other actions. The internal behavior of this function is not relevant
to us---it is used by the Weaver Game Engine to perform operations of
its own. Similarly, after the file is loaded---or even if loading
fails due to an error---we must call the
\monoespaco{after\_loading\_interface} function. Again, its effects
are not our concern. If either of these function pointers is NULL,
they should simply be ignored and not executed.

The remaining parameters received by the loading function are for data
allocation and deallocation. We must distinguish between temporary and
permanent allocations. Permanent allocations are meant for data that
must remain valid after the extraction function returns. Temporary
allocations are only needed during file reading. Each allocation
function has a corresponding deallocation function. However, the
deallocation function may be NULL---in such cases, we will not invoke
it, assuming that some form of automatic memory management is in
place.

Because the allocation and deallocation functions may be needed not
only by the extraction function but also by various auxiliary
routines, we will store them in static global variables. If the values
were not initialized, we will assume that we should use the allocation
and deallocation functions from standard library.

@<Local Variables (wave.c)@>=
static void *(*permanent_alloc)(size_t) = malloc;
static void *(*temporary_alloc)(size_t) = malloc;
static void (*permanent_free)(void *) = free;
static void (*temporary_free)(void *) = free;
@

\subsecao{1.1. Literate Programming}

Our API will be written using the literate programming technique,
proposed by Knuth on [Knuth, 1984]. It consist in writting a computer
program explaining didactically in a text what is being done while
presenting the code. The program is compiled extracting the computer
code directly from the didactical text. The code shall be presented in
a way and order such that it is best for explaining for a human. Not
how it would be easier to compile.

Using this technique, this document is not a simple documentation for
our code. It is the code by itself. The part that will be extracted to
be compiled can be identified by a gray background. We begin each
piece of code by a title that names it. For example, immediately
before this subsection we presented a series of function
declarations. And how one could deduct by the title, most of them will
be positioned in the file \monoespaco{interface.h}.

We show below the structure of the file \monoespaco{wave.h}:

@(src/wave.h@>=
#ifndef __WEAVER_INTERFACE_WAVE
#define __WEAVER_INTERFACE_WAVE
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
#include <stdbool.h> // Define  'bool' type
#include <stdlib.h>
@<Function Declaration (wave.h)@>
#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
#endif
@

The code above shows the default boilerplate for defining a header in
our C API. The first two lines and the last one are macros that ensure
the header is not included more than once in a single compilation
unit. Lines 3, 4, 5, and the three lines before the last one make the
header compatible with C++ code. These lines tell the compiler that we
are using C code and, therefore, it can apply optimizations assuming
that no C++-specific features---such as operator overloading---will be
used.

Next, we include a header that allows us to use boolean variables. You
may also notice some parts highlighted in red. One of them is labeled
``Function Declaration (wave.h)'', the same title used for most of
the code declared earlier. This means that all previously defined code
blocks with that title will be inserted at this point in the file. The
other red-highlighted parts represent code that we will define in the
following sections.

If you want to understand how the \monoespaco{wave.c} file
relates to this header, its structure is as follows:

@(src/wave.c@>=
#include "wave.h"
#include <AL/al.h>
#include <AL/alc.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
@<Local Headers (wave.c)@>
@<Local Variables (wave.c)@>
@<Local Functions Declaration (wave.c)@>
@<Auxiliary Local Functions (wave.c)@>
@<API Functions Definition (wave.c)@>
@

All the code presented in this document will be placed in one of these
two files. No other files will be created.

\secao{2. The RIFF-WAVE Format}

We will create an auxiliary function named
\monoespaco{interpret\_wave}, which will perform most of the work
required to interpret the WAVE format and initialize an OpenAL buffer
from it. This function will be invoked within the extraction function
as follows:

@<API Functions Definition (wave.c)@>=
void _extract_wave(void *(*perm_alloc)(size_t),
                   void (*perm_free)(void *),
                   void *(*temp_alloc)(size_t),
                   void (*temp_free)(void *),
                   void (*before_loading_interface)(void),
                   void (*after_loading_interface)(void),
                   char *source_filename, void *interface){
  struct sound *snd;
  if(before_loading_interface != NULL)
    before_loading_interface();
  snd = (struct sound *) interface;
  permanent_alloc = perm_alloc;
  permanent_free = perm_free;
  temporary_alloc = temp_alloc;
  temporary_free = temp_free;
  if(interpret_wave(source_filename, snd -> buffer))
    snd -> _loaded_sound = true;
  if(after_loading_interface != NULL)
    after_loading_interface();
}
@

To understand what the interpret_wave function should do, we need to
briefly explain how the WAVE---or more precisely, RIFF-WAVE---format
works. Every WAVE file is also a RIFF file. A RIFF file is composed of
one or more ``chunks''. Fortunately, in the specific case of the WAVE
format, things are simpler: the entire file is made up of a single
chunk.

Each chunk consists of three parts: 4 bytes containing ASCII
characters that identify the chunk type, 4 bytes indicating the size
of the chunk data, and then a sequence of bytes of the specified size
representing the actual data. The data section may also include
padding bytes if the actual content is slightly shorter than the
declared size. All numeric values must be read using little-endian
byte order.

In WAVE files, the first and only chunk in the file must begin with
the ASCII identifier ``RIFF''.

With this information, we can now proceed to read the first 8 bytes of
the file:

@<Auxiliary Local Functions (wave.c)@>=
bool interpret_wave(char *filename, ALuint buffer){
  FILE *fp;
  fp = fopen(filename, "r");
  if(fp == NULL){
    perror(filename);
    return false;
  }
  {
    char buf[4];
    size_t ret;
    // Reading 'RIFF':
    ret = fread(buf, 1, 4, fp);
    if(ret != 4){
      perror(filename);
      return false;
    }
    if(buf[0] != 'R' || buf[1] != 'I' || buf[2] != 'F' || buf[3] != 'F'){
      fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: %s not a RIFF file.\n", filename);
      return false;
    }
    // Reading data size in main chunk:
    ret = fread(buf, 1, 4, fp);
    if(ret != 4){
      perror(filename);
      return false;
    }
    @<Interpret WAVE File@>
  }
  fclose(fp);
  return true;
}
@

There are two special chunk types in the RIFF format: RIFF and
LIST. We can safely ignore the latter. However, the former is crucial,
since---as we've seen---every WAVE file consists of a large chunk of
type RIFF.

What makes these chunk types special is that their data region
contains multiple subchunks, each following the same pattern: a 4-byte
ASCII identifier for the subchunk type, a 4-byte size field, and a
data section.

However, before the list of subchunks begins, the data region starts
with 4 ASCII bytes that serve as a label. In the case of WAVE files,
this label is always "WAVE". Let's interpret this part of the file:

@<Interpret WAVE File@>=
// Reading 'WAVE':
ret = fread(buf, 1, 4, fp);
if(ret != 4){
  perror(filename);
  return false;
}
if(buf[0] != 'W' || buf[1] != 'A' || buf[2] != 'V' || buf[3] != 'E'){
  fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: %s not a WAVE file.\n", filename);
  return false;
}
@

After this part, we read the sub-chunks:

@<Interpret WAVE File@>+=
struct audio_data audio;
while(read_chunk(fp, filename, &audio));
@

The \monoespaco{read\_chunk} function will be responsible for reading
a single chunk and, based on its contents, updating the
\monoespaco{audio\_data} structure, which will hold all the necessary
information to generate our audio. As long as it successfully reads a
complete chunk, it should return true. If it encounters an error or
reaches the end of the file, it must return false.

The attributes of the \monoespaco{audio\_data} structure will be
defined later. For now, we declare it as follows:

@<Local Variables (wave.c)@>+=
struct audio_data{
  @<struct audio_data: Struct Variables@>
};
@

We now move on to the function that reads the subchunks. The WAVE
specification defines six different subchunk types. However, in
practice, only two mandatory types are commonly used: the ``fmt''
subchunk, which contains information about the audio format, and the
``data'' subchunk, which holds the actual audio data.

The specification states that any unrecognized subchunk should be
safely ignored.

Our function for interpreting subchunks is defined as follows:

@<Local Functions Declaration (wave.c)@>=
bool read_chunk(FILE *fp, char *filename, struct audio_data *);
@

@<Auxiliary Local Functions (wave.c)@>+=
bool read_chunk(FILE *fp, char *filename, struct audio_data *audio){
  size_t ret;
  // Lendo o tipo do 'chunk' nos 4 primeiros caracteres
  char type[4];
  ret = fread(type, 1, 4, fp);
  if(ret != 4){
    if(feof(fp))
      return false; // End of file, not an error
    else{
      perror(filename); // Error
      return false;
    }
  }
  if(type[0] == 'f' && type[1] == 'm' && type[2] == 't' && type[3] == ' ')
    return read_fmt_chunk(fp, filename, audio);
  else if(type[0] == 'd' && type[1] == 'a' && type[2] == 't' && type[3] == 'a')
    return read_data_chunk(fp, filename, audio);
  else
    return read_unknown_chunk(fp, filename, audio);
}
@

Note that there are three different types of functions, each
responsible for interpreting a specific type of subchunk. We will
start with the simplest one---the function that handles an unknown
subchunk type. In this case, we will simply skip its contents.

To do that, we just need to read the next 4 bytes, which indicate the
size of the subchunk’s data, and then ignore all subsequent bytes up
to the end of the subchunk:

@<Local Functions Declaration (wave.c)@>+=
bool read_unknown_chunk(FILE *fp, char *filename, struct audio_data *);
@

@<Auxiliary Local Functions (wave.c)@>+=
bool read_unknown_chunk(FILE *fp, char *filename, struct audio_data *audio){
  unsigned long size;
  char buffer[4];
  size_t ret;
  ret = fread(buffer, 1, 4, fp);
  if(ret != 4){
    perror(filename);
    return false;
  }
  size = buffer[0] + (256 * buffer[1]) + (256 * 256 * buffer[2]) +
         (256 * 256 * 256 * buffer[3]);
  if(fseek(fp, size, SEEK_CUR) != 0){
    perror(filename);
    return false;
  }
  return true;  
}
@

The next subchunk we need to read is the format subchunk, identified
by the string ``fmt '' (with a trailing space to make up 4
bytes). According to the WAVE specification, this subchunk is
mandatory and must always appear before the subchunk containing the
actual audio data.

The WAVE format is not a single, fixed format--there are multiple
variants, each with its own characteristics. The format we will
support here is the most common one: Microsoft Pulse Code Modulation,
or Microsoft PCM, which represents the vast majority of WAVE files
found on the Internet.

For this format, the first 4 bytes after the size in the format
subchunk must contain the number 1. This serves as the identifier for
PCM. If we encounter a different value, it indicates an unsupported
format, and we should return an error.

The next 4-byte value specifies the number of audio channels. Common
values are 1 for mono and 2 for stereo.

Following that, we have 8 bytes representing the sampling rate
(samples per second per channel). For example, CD-quality audio
typically uses 44100, while telephone-quality audio might use 8000.

The next 8 bytes represent the average number of bytes per second that
must be transferred to play the sound. This value is typically used to
help size streaming audio buffers. Since our implementation loads the
entire audio into memory, we can ignore it. Similarly, the following 4
bytes relate to block alignment in memory and are also mainly relevant
for streaming implementations.

Therefore, the only values we need to extract and store in our audio
structure are the number of channels and the sampling rate. These
values should be saved into our audio_data structure as follows:

@<struct audio_data: Struct Variables@>=
uint32_t channel;
uint64_t sample_rate;
@

Below is the declaration and implementation of the function that reads
the format subchunk:

@<Local Functions Declaration (wave.c)@>+=
bool read_fmt_chunk(FILE *fp, char *filename, struct audio_data *);
@

@<Auxiliary Local Functions (wave.c)@>+=
bool read_fmt_chunk(FILE *fp, char *filename, struct audio_data *audio){
  char buffer[8];
  size_t ret;
  // Ignoring the size (WAVE in Microsoft PCM format always has same size)
  if(fseek(fp, 4, SEEK_CUR) != 0){
    perror(filename);
    return false;
  }
  // Reading format: must be 1 for Microsoft PCM
  ret = fread(buffer, 1, 4, fp);
  if(ret != 4){
    perror(filename);
    return false;
  }
  if(buffer[0] != 1 || buffer[1] != 0 || buffer[2] != 0 || buffer[3] != 0){
    fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: WAV file %s is not in Microsoft PCM format.\n",
            filename);
    return false;
  }
  // Reading number of channels
  ret = fread(buffer, 1, 4, fp);
  if(ret != 4){
    perror(filename);
    return false;
  }
  audio -> channel = buffer[0] + 256 * buffer[1] + 256 * 256 * buffer[2] +
                     256 * 256 * 256 * buffer[3];
  // Reading sampling rate
  ret = fread(buffer, 1, 8, fp);
  if(ret != 8){
    perror(filename);
    return false;
  }
  audio -> sample_rate = buffer[0] +
                         buffer[1] * 256 +
			 buffer[2] * 256 * 256 +
			 buffer[3] * 256 * 256 * 256 +
			 buffer[4] * 256 * 256 * 256 * 256 +
			 buffer[5] * 256 * 256 * 256 * 256 * 256 +
			 buffer[6] * 256 * 256 * 256 * 256 * 256 * 256 +
			 buffer[7] * 256 * 256 * 256 * 256 * 256 * 256 * 256;
  // Ignoring next 12 bytes:
  if(fseek(fp, 12, SEEK_CUR) != 0){
    perror(filename);
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}
